<span class="fontstyle0">My research spans across the areas of security and privacy in/using computing devices, machine learning, the human aspect of cybersecurity, human-computer interaction, and mobile and wearable sensible user behavior. My dissertation explored new authentication/deauthentication and privacy paradigms, from both offensive and defensive perspectives, in/using mobile, wearable, and IoT computing leveraging various embedded sensors (e.g., audio sensors, such as microphones and speakers, and motion-position sensors, such as accelerometer and gyroscope). My research articles have been published at various top security venues, including CCS, NDSS, WiSec, and ACM-CSUR and received considerable attention at major news outlets, such as Forensic Magazine, Science Daily, IT Security News, TechXplore, Naked Security, Webroot, Scientific Computing, Helpnet Security, SD Times, ECN, etc. </span>

<em>I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the  <a href="http://www.uab.edu/home/">University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB)</a>, USA, and a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from <a href="http://www.tribhuvan-university.edu.np/">Tribhuvan University</a>, Nepal. </em>
